# audibuddy
this is the code for our application audibuddy
this is an android application for speech and hearning impaired people.
this application will have two main features - converting sppech to text and converting text to speech
in convering speech to text , we will use 2 modules that are speech recognition and pyaudio
in converting text to speech we will use 1 module that is gTTs( google Text To speech)
in both features , we will have a number of languages that will be english, hindi, kannada, tamil, telugu, malyalam but that is for later
we will use kivy framework to make it for android and perhaps ios is we have time
in kivy, we will have to use python classes. I am not exactly a master at classes considering that i learnt them yesterday but we can do it, we have time
